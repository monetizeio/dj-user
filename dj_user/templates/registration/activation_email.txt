  Used to generate the body of the activation email. Should display a link the
  user can click to activate the account. I would prefer to put this in the
  ‘account/’ directory with the other registration and activation templates,
  but the template path is unfortunately hard-coded by Django-registration.
  This template has the following context:

    activation_key
      The activation key for the new account.

    expiration_days
      The number of days remaining during which the account may be activated.

    site
      An object representing the site on which the user registered; depending
      on whether “django.contrib.sites” is installed, this may be an instance
      of either “django.contrib.sites.models.Site” (if the sites application
      is installed) or “django.contrib.sites.models.RequestSite” (if not).
      Consult the documentation for the Django sites framework
      <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/> for details
      regarding these objects' interfaces.

  FIXME: figure out the best way to modify the Django-registration API to
         provide customized template names, so we can put this in the
         ‘account/’ directory, and file a bug report.

You (or someone pretending to be you!) have registered an account at {{ site.name }}, which has to be activated. To do this, please follow the following link within the next {{ expiration_days }} days:

http://{{site.domain}}/account/activate/{{ activation_key }}

If it wasn't you that registered this account, please ignore this email and your address will be removed from our records in due time.

Do not reply to this automated email. Instead, please direct your correspondence to <support@{{site.domain}}>.

Sincerely,
{{ site.name }} Management
