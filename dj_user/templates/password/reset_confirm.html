  Used to present the form users to enter a new password during the password
  reset process. By default, the template is provided with the following
  context:

    form
      The password reset form. This will be an instance of some subclass of
      “django.forms.Form”; consult Django's forms documentation
      <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/> for information on
      how to display this in a template.

    validlink
      A Boolean value that evaluates to True if the token in the URL is
      validated and represents a legitimate password reset request, and
      evaluates as False otherwise.
